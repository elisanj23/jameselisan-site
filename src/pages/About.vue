    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hey! This is James. I considered myself a software developer
      since 2018. 
    </p>

    <p>This blog is my launchpad for honing my writing skills and broadcasting my thoughts to the world. It's a mere blip in the expansive cosmos of information. Here, I'll be unveiling my upcoming blogs and projects, so keep your eyes peeled for the countdown! ðŸš€</p>

  <p>This site is free from ads, affiliate links, tracking, or any paywalls. I'm here to improve my writing skills and share what matters to me with you!
